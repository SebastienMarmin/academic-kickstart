[Krikamol Muandet](https://krikamol.org/) is a research group leader affiliated with the Empirical Inference Department at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://www.is.mpg.de/en), TÃ¼bingen, Germany.

He presented a method for
learning  meaningful  causal  relationships  under  the influence  of  unobserved  confounders.

I talked with him about the connections with machine learning and Bayesian nets in particular.
