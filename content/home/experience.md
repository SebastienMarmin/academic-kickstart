> <div style="text-align: justify">In closing, my opinion of this work is strongly favorable. I believe it meets—indeed, well exceeds—the threshold for advancing to defense and ultimately to the awarding the degree of Ph.D. at any of the top academic institutions world wide. The work is innovative, well documented, and will have substantial impact once converted into journal/conference publication form.</div>
